## üìã Preset Rules

### Rule Structure
Each preset contains an array of rules with:
- **find**: Text pattern to search for (supports RegExp)
- **replace**: Replacement text or pattern
- **priority**: Execution order (lower numbers = higher priority)

### Supported Patterns
- **Simple Text**: Direct string replacement
- **Character Classes**: `[!@#$%^&*()]` removes specified characters
- **Escape Sequences**: `\n`, `\t`, `\r` for whitespace handling
- **Regular Expressions**: Full RegExp support for complex patterns

### Example Rules
```json
{
  "find": "[!@#$%^&*()]",
  "replace": "",
  "priority": 1
}
```
